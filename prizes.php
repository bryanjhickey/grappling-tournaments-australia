			<h4 class="subheader">What is on offer?</h4>
			<p>One of the big goals of GTA is to give as many of our outstanding athletes as possible the trip of a lifetime overseas to the World Championships. As a result we sponsor stand-out competitors from the GTA events for trips to train and compete in the US.</p>
			<p>The sponsorship package includes airfare, pre comp training camp with Robert Drysdale and competition entry (students must organise all annual memberships to IBJJF and membership cards through their own coach / school).</p>
			<p>As a minimum we send the following athletes to compete in the World Championships:</p>
			<ul class="no-bullet">
				<li>1 x Male Blue Belt</li>
				<li>1 x Male Purple Belt</li>
				<li>1 x Male Brown Belt</li>
				<li>1x Female Blue or Purple Belt</li>
			</ul>
			<p>GTA is 100% non profit and run completely by volunteers. We have a great number of people from so many different schools who donate their time, money and resources to see the GTA events succeed.</p>
			<p>After we pay for the essentials of venue hire and first aid every cent from entry fees goes back to sending competitors overseas. We are also fortunate to have amazing sponsors who donate product and money to increase our funds.</p>
			<p>So in a nutshell the more people who enter the tournaments the more athletes we send overseas!</p>
			<p>The simple fact is there are many competitors out there who might never experience jiu jitsu on the world stage if not for sponsorship. Our motivation in running the GTA events is to give these individuals the chance to get overseas to train and compete as part of a team, have an amazing experience, and inflame the passion in them (and those around them) for our amazing art or jiu jitsu. </p>
			<p>It is hard to describe how inspiring, motivating and exceptional the experience of competing on the world stage is. It completely changes the way we feel about jiu jitsu and opens up our minds to what is possible for us as individuals in the sport and Aussies. These trips drive and motivate us to achieve more. The training camps and competition expose us to new or different ideas, techniques and training. Not only does the individual going to the Worlds benefit but so do their team mates in helping them prepare and on sponsored athletes return with all the Jiu Jitsu awesomeness they bring back!</p>

			<h4 class="subheader">Who can win it?</h4>
			<p>Anyone who makes it on to the podium (1st, 2nd or 3rd) in both their weight class and open weight can be selected for sponsorship if from Australia or NZ.  School or affiliation does not matter at all. The previous trips have been spread through an awesome mix of schools and affiliations.</p>
			<p>Typically winners of the open weight divisions have earned sponsorship. However it is important to note, simply going by winners of the open division tends to bias things in favor of the heavier athletes. As such it is important we consider athletes overall performance in both weight and open division.</p>
			<h4 class="subheader">Why they win?</h4>
			<p>The sponsorship goes to stand out competitors. This means technical level, dedication, sportsmanship and attitude. It is vitally important we grow jiu jitsu in a positive and community based way. As a result we consider being a great person off the mat is as important as being amazing on the mat.</p>
			<p>Although we compete as individuals we improve only with the help of our coaches and team mates. All the sponsored athletes are not only great jits players but also genuinely positive, happy and helpful people and understand they, we, are part of a bigger team and community.</p>
			<h4 class="subheader">Who decides?</h4>
			<p>The organisers and head referees meet to discuss and come to a consensus on the stand outs in each of the various divisions. </p>
