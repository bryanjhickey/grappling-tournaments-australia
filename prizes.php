			<h2>Prizes</h2>
			<h4 class="subheader">What is on offer?</h4>
			<p>GTA is 100% non-profit and run completely by volunteers. We have a great number of people from many different schools who donate their time, money and resources to see the GTA events succeed.</p>
			<p>Our goal is simple: to improve the level of Jiu Jitsu here in Australasia by helping as many of our top athletes as possible compete overseas at the IBJJF World Championships.</p>
			<p>After we pay for the essentials of venue hire, first aid, etc. every cent from entry fees goes back to the athletes in the form of sponsorships. This means that the more people who compete, the more sponsorships we can offer! </p>
			<p>The simple fact is that there are many competitors out there who might never experience Jiu Jitsu on the world stage if not for our sponsorship. The motivation in running the GTA events is to give these individuals the chance to get overseas, participate in pre-competition  training and compete as part of a team. We want you to have an amazing experience, and inflame your passion - and the passion of those around you - for our amazing art of Jiu Jitsu. As a result we offer sponsorships to outstanding athletes to help them compete at the IBJJF World Championships each year in Los Angeles.</p>
			<p>It is hard to describe how inspiring, motivating and exceptional the experience is of competing on the world stage. It completely changes the way we feel about jiu jitsu and opens up our minds to what is possible for us as individuals in the sport and as Aussies representing our country. These trips drive and motivate us to achieve more. The training camps and competition expose us to new and different ideas, techniques and training programs. Not only does the individual  going to the Worlds benefit but so do their team mates in helping them prepare. When a sponsored athlete returns they share all the Jiu Jitsu awesomeness that they have brought back!</p>
			<p>The sponsorship package includes airfare, pre-competition training camp, and competition entry. Students must organise all annual memberships to IBJJF and membership cards through their own coach / school.</p>
			<p>As a minimum, we send the following athletes to compete in the World Championships:</p>
			<ul class="no-bullet">
				<li>1 x Male Blue Belt</li>
				<li>1 x Male Purple Belt</li>
				<li>1 x Male Brown Belt</li>
				<li>1 x Male Black Belt</li>
				<li>1 x Female Blue Belt</li>
				<li>1 x Female Purple Belt</li>
				<li>4 x WILD CARDS to outstanding Athletes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>WHITE BELTS are competing to win a $1,500 sponsorship package which takes the form of training gear and other cool kit to help their training and aid them in becoming outstanding coloured belts when the time arrives.</p>
			<h4 class="subheader">Who can win it?</h4>
			<p>Winners of all male and female COLOURED BELT OPEN WEIGHT divisions are guaranteed an offer of sponsorship.</p>
			<p>There are also a number of wild cards offered to outstanding athletes on the day!</p>
			<h4 class="subheader">Why they win?</h4>
			<p>The sponsorship offers go to stand-out competitors. This means technical level, dedication, sportsmanship and attitude. It is vitally important we grow Jiu Jitsu in a positive and community based way. As a result we consider being a great person off the mat is as important as being amazing on the mat.</p>
			<p>Although we compete as individuals we improve only with the help of our coaches and team mates. All the sponsored athletes are not only great at Jiu Jitsu but also genuinely positive, happy and helpful people and understand that  they are part of a bigger team and community.</p>
			<h4 class="subheader">Who decides?</h4>
			<p>The WILD CARDS are decided by the event organisers and Black Belt referees who come to a consensus on the stand-out  athletes from the competition.</p>
