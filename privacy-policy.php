<h3>Sharing of Data</h3>
<p>We don't share your personal information with third parties. Only aggregated, anonymised data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the GTA Website and service. We currently use <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> (traffic analysis, SEO optimization) and <a href="http://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">Mailchimp</a> (mailing list management). We listed below what data these third parties extract exactly. Feel free to check out their own Privacy Policies to find out more.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Google Analytics: anonymous (ad serving domains, browser type, demographics, language settings, page views, time/date), pseudonymous (IP address)</li>
	<li>Mailchimp: name and email of our beta subscription list</li>
</ul>
<p>We also use social buttons provided by services like Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and Facebook. Your use of these third party services is entirely optional.

Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
